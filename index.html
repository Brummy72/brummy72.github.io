        <h1 style=" font-family: cursive; font-size: 60px;">Dear Kynslee,</h1>
        <p style=" font-size: 30px;">Over the last 2-3 years we've spent together, we've had lots of ups and downs. But every moment with you has been incredibly special to me. My love for you is to indescribable to be put into words, it's a deep connection that makes my heart feel tugged every day.  You are the first thing on my mind when I wake up and the last thing on my mind as I go to sleep. When I went to college, and we had to do the long-distance thing, it made our relationship more complicated. But it also made our bond even stronger. Even though we're far apart, I feel like you're right there with me, supporting me every step of the way. We've faced challenges and come through them, making us even tougher. You're not just the love of my life, but my inspiration.
            No matter what life throws at us, I'm completely devoted to you, and my love for you will always be there. Having you in my life is a constant blessing, and I'll cherish and love you always.
