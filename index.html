            <h1 id="am">About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a dedicated undergraduate student currently attending West Virginia University, where I am passionately pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have a strong affinity for problem solving and critical thinking activities, which have driven my academic and personal interests.

                My journey in civil engineering has not only equipped me with a deep understanding of the principles that shape our physical world but has also honed my skills in creative problem solving. My concurrent minor in computer science has enabled me to blend the realms of technology and engineering, fostering a well-rounded perspective on modern infrastructure and construction.
                
                As a student, I am committed to excellence, continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative solutions. I believe that the ability to think critically and adapt to ever-evolving challenges is essential in the fields of civil engineering and computer science. I am excited to translate my passion for problem solving into tangible contributions in the engineering industry.</p>
